# Personal Text Editor
A text editor being created as a personal project.

It makes use of SDL2 for the window and rendering at this moment in time.

At this moment in time, it is very basic.  It is capable of opening and closing a text file encoded in ANSI, and edit the text with basic keyboard input.  Future capabilities planned in the near future:
-Letting the user save and load text files (encoded in ANSI) during runtime
-Adding additional mouse support
-Upgrading the UI

This project is not intended for anything serious at this moment in time.  It was developed personal learning purposes and experimentation.
